A version of my Portfolio / CV in the form of a classic RPG level.

Boilerplate taken from https://github.com/cloakedninjas/phaser-typescript-boilerplate


## Building

`grunt dev --force` for single build or `grunt watch` to compile as you make changes.

## Running

Built files are placed into the `public/` directory. Point a webserver at it, and you're away!

`http-server public`
